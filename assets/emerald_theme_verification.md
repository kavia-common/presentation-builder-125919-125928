# Emerald Theme Verification – PPTX Export and UI Preview

Scope: Verify whether the emerald theme parameters are fully mapped and respected in exported PPTX slides and the UI ThemePreview. Also summarize status for all themes, since templates and theme utilities are generic.

Reviewed artifacts:
- Export logic and templates:
  - src/services/themes.js
  - src/services/templates.js (updated to use theme.spacing and true PPT bullets)
  - src/services/ppt.js
- UI:
  - src/components/ThemePreview.jsx (updated to show bullet sample reflecting tokens)
- Tests:
  - src/services/ppt.themes.test.js (extended for bullets and card tokens)
- Prior visual screenshot for emerald title-bullets layout:

Verification matrix (applies to all themes, example values shown for emerald):

- Colors
  - Primary: USED (primaryColor() in flowchart connectors), emerald.primary=065F46
  - Accent: USED (accentColor() for dividers), emerald.accent=10B981
  - Background: USED (slideOptionsForTheme), emerald.background=F0FDF4
  - Text: USED (title/body/caption styles), emerald.text=052E16
  - Muted/Border/White/Black: USED where relevant (caption, card line/fill)
  - Status: PASS

- Typography
  - Title/h1/h2/body/caption fontSize/bold/color: USED via titleTextStyle/bodyTextStyle/captionTextStyle with WCAG contrast enforcement
  - Status: PASS

- Cards
  - fill.line.shadow.shape: USED via cardShapeOptions(theme) and shape type in COMPARISON, IMAGE_CARD, CHART placeholder, and FLOWCHART nodes
  - Status: PASS

- Bullets
  - bulletColor: USED (derived from theme.bullets or body color)
  - bulletSize: USED (options.bulletSize)
  - indentLevel: USED (options.indentLevel and indent mirror)
  - Rendering: TRUE PPT bullets with newline-separated paragraphs (no manual “•” prefix)
  - Status: PASS

- Spacing
  - pageMarginX/pageMarginY/gutter: USED in FLOWCHART; NOW applied across TITLE_BULLETS, BULLETS, IMAGE_CARD, IMAGE_LEFT/RIGHT, TWO_COLUMN, CHART, SECTION_DIVIDER (x/w/y sizes respect theme spacing; see templates.js)
  - Status: PASS

Findings and implemented fixes

1) True PPT bullets and bullet tokens
   - Before: bullets were previously text-only in some codebases; now bulletListOptions(theme) sets bullet, bulletColor, bulletSize, and both indentLevel and indent for cross-compatibility.
   - Applied templates: TITLE_BULLETS, BULLETS, IMAGE_LEFT/RIGHT text regions, TWO_COLUMN, CHART fallback.
   - Tests added to assert bulletColor, bulletSize, and indent mappings for emerald and spacing influence on positions.

2) Spacing tokens applied
   - Introduced getSpacing(theme) helper and parameterized coordinates and widths in templates to respect pageMarginX/Y and gutter consistently across templates.
   - FLOWCHART already used spacing; others now do as well.

3) UI ThemePreview parity
   - Added a bullet sample that approximates PPT bullet tokens using CSS:
     - font-size ≈ bulletSize
     - indent ≈ indentLevel inches converted to ~96 px/in
     - color = bulletColor
   - Note: CSS is an approximation for preview purposes only.

4) Tests extended
   - Verified:
     - Background tokens applied (existing)
     - Title color applied (existing)
     - Accent lines retain token when autoAccent=false (existing)
     - NEW: Bullets token mapping (color/size/indent) and spacing-based x for TITLE_BULLETS
     - NEW: Cards token mapping for COMPARISON

Conclusion

- The emerald theme (and all themes) now have full token coverage across PPTX export and UI preview for:
  - colors, typography, cards, bullets, and spacing.
- Auto-accent behavior remains opt-in (default on) and is documented/covered by tests.
- Future work: If font families are introduced as tokens, plumb them into title/body/caption styles and preview.
